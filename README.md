# kv-store

An in-memory key-value store built from scratch in C++17. No external dependencies.

Implements LRU eviction and TTL expiry — designed as a Redis replacement for a URL Shortener backend.

**Stack:** C++17 · CMake 3.20 · Clang 18 / GCC 13 · pthreads · WSL (Ubuntu 24.04)

## Core Components

### LRU Eviction

`unordered_map<string, Node*>` + doubly linked list with dummy sentinels.

- HashMap gives O(1) lookup
- DLL maintains recency order — MRU at head, LRU at tail
- On capacity overflow, tail node is evicted and erased from the map

### TTL Expiry

`std::priority_queue<TTLNode>` min-heap ordered by expiry time, with lazy deletion.

- `Node::expTime` holds `optional<time_point>` — `nullopt` means the key never expires
- Lazy expiry check on every GET/EXISTS/INCR before returning a value
- On SET or EXPIRE, a new heap entry is pushed — stale entries are discarded during active eviction by comparing heap entry expiry against the node's current expiry

### Background Eviction Thread

Active eviction runs on a background thread started in the constructor and stopped cleanly in the destructor.

- Instead of sleeping a fixed interval, the thread checks the TTL heap top and sleeps until the nearest key's expiry time. Falls back to `evictInterval` seconds when the heap is empty
- When a new key comes in with an earlier expiry than the current heap top, `cv.notify_one()` wakes the thread early to recalculate its next wakeup time
- Uses `cv.wait_until()` instead of `sleep_for` — so the destructor can wake it immediately on shutdown rather than waiting out the full sleep
- Two mutexes protect shared state: `mapMtx` for the store + DLL, `heapMtx` for the TTL heap. A third `evictionMtx` is used only with the condition variable — so the sleeping thread never blocks GET/SET operations

### TCP Server

Handles client connections over TCP on a configurable port.

- Binds to `0.0.0.0:port` — accepts connections from any network interface
- Thread pool of 10 worker threads pre-created at startup — bounded resource usage, no per-connection thread spawn overhead
- `accept()` loop runs on a dedicated thread — pushes client fds into a shared queue
- Worker threads block on `cv.wait()` — zero CPU when idle, exactly one worker wakes per new client via `notify_one()`
- Persistent connections — one worker thread serves one client for the lifetime of the connection
- `activeClients` atomic counter — 11th client gets `-ERR max clients reached\r\n` and is rejected
- `SO_REUSEADDR` set — server restarts immediately without waiting for OS `TIME_WAIT` to expire
- O(1) command routing via `commandRegistry` — `unordered_map<string, {expectedArgs, lambda}>`, no if-chain

### RESP Protocol Parser

Parses incoming RESP arrays into structured commands. Separate from the server layer — no socket knowledge.

- Protocol format: `*N, dbIndex, command, args...`
- `ParseErr` namespace — all parse error strings as constants, every error path populates `errorMsg`
- `ParseStatus` enum — `OK`, `INCOMPLETE`, `INVALID_FORMAT`, `INVALID_DB_INDEX`, `UNKNOWN_COMMAND`
- `INCOMPLETE` lets `handleClient()` accumulate bytes across multiple `recv()` calls — handles TCP chunking correctly
- `ResponseType` enum + `serialize()` — formats all RESP response types
- No pipelining — one command per parse call (sync clients send one command, wait for response)

### Configuration

Server is started with a config file path:

```bash
./kv-store config.json
```

Config file format (JSON, parser in progress):
```json
{
    "port": 6379,
    "databases": [
        { "maxCapacity": 1000, "ttl": 60, "evictInterval": 60 },
        { "maxCapacity": 500,  "ttl": 120, "evictInterval": 60 }
    ]
}
```

Multiple store instances — clients specify which to query via `dbIndex` in every request.

---

## Wire Protocol

Commands are sent as RESP arrays. Format: `*N\r\n` followed by N bulk strings `$len\r\ndata\r\n`.

Argument order: `dbIndex, command, args...`

```
SET on db 0:
*4\r\n$1\r\n0\r\n$3\r\nSET\r\n$3\r\nfoo\r\n$3\r\nbar\r\n

GET on db 1:
*3\r\n$1\r\n1\r\n$3\r\nGET\r\n$3\r\nfoo\r\n
```

Responses:
```
+OK\r\n          — success (SET, DEL, EXPIRE)
$3\r\nfoo\r\n    — bulk string (GET value)
$-1\r\n          — null (GET miss)
:1\r\n           — integer (EXISTS, INCR)
-ERR msg\r\n     — error
```

## Commands

| Command | Signature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `SET` | `SET key value isExpires(0/1)` | Store a key. Pass `0` for no expiry |
| `GET` | `GET key` | Returns value or null if missing or expired |
| `DEL` | `DEL key` | Delete a key |
| `EXISTS` | `EXISTS key` | Returns 1 if key exists and is not expired |
| `EXPIRE` | `EXPIRE key seconds` | Set TTL for a key — effective value is `max(store_ttl, seconds)` |
| `INCR` | `INCR key` | Increments integer value by 1. If key is missing or expired, initializes to 1 with no TTL. Returns `-ERR` if value is not an integer or out of range. |
| `CLEAR` | `CLEAR` | Delete all keys in the selected database |

## Design Decisions

**`std::optional<string>` for GET** — empty string `""` is a valid value. Using it as a sentinel creates ambiguity. `std::optional` makes absence explicit.

**`expTime` stored in `Node`** — lazy expiry on GET requires O(1) check per key. The heap only exposes its top, so expiry time must be on the node itself.

**Lazy heap deletion** — `std::priority_queue` has no random access or in-place update. On TTL update, a new entry is pushed and the stale one is discarded during `removeExpKeys()`.

**`size_t` for capacity and TTL** — `store.size()` returns `size_t`. Mixing with `int` causes signed/unsigned comparison warnings and silent wraparound on negative values.

**Minimum TTL of 60 seconds** — enforced as `max(store_default_ttl, user_input)`. Sub-minute TTLs cause unnecessary churn in a cache use case.

**Two separate mutexes for store and heap** — `mapMtx` and `heapMtx` are kept separate so heap iteration during eviction doesn't block concurrent GET/SET on the store. A third `evictionMtx` is used only with the condition variable to avoid blocking GET/SET while the eviction thread is sleeping.

**`removeExpKeys()` releases `heapMtx` before touching the store** — holding both locks simultaneously would create a circular wait with SET/EXPIRE (which acquire `mapMtx` then `heapMtx`). Releasing `heapMtx` first eliminates the deadlock.

**Thread pool over one-thread-per-client** — bounded resource usage. One thread per client would allow unbounded thread creation — 1000 clients = 1000 threads = potential OOM. Pool of 10 caps memory usage and matches expected number of persistent app server connections.

**Persistent connections** — app servers connect once and reuse the connection for all requests. Avoids TCP 3-way handshake overhead on every command.

**RESP parser separate from TCPServer** — parser has no socket knowledge, server has no protocol knowledge. Each component has one job and can be tested independently.

**O(1) command routing via `commandRegistry`** — `unordered_map<string, {expectedArgs, lambda}>` instead of an if-chain. Adding a new command means adding one entry to the map — no touching existing logic.

**Config file over hardcoded values** — server started as `./kv-store config.json`. Production and test environments use different config files — no code changes needed.

**Protocol-compliant Expiry** — When a key expires, its existence and TTL metadata are completely wiped. Calling a mutating operation (like `INCR`) on a recently expired key initializes a brand new node with no TTL, strictly enforcing the rule that the server does not guess client intentions for stale data.
